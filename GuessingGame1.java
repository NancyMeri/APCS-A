/* Create a program that will use a while loop to play a guessing game. 
 * Your game should have (1) a variable that holds the winning number 
 * between the values of 1 and 100 inclusive (you should use Math.random() 
 * to generate this number), and (2) a variable that will hold the userâ€™s 
 * guess. Incorporate if statements to guide the user towards the right 
 * answer (e.g. let the know if their guess is too high or too low).
