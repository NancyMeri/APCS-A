Practice Labs and Solutions for AP Computer Science A

Here I will explain the format of this repository, which is extra Labs to do in AP Computer Science A from my high school's class.

Unit 1: Primitive Types
First, you can take a look at HelloWorld.java, which is typically the first program students write.
ScannerExample.java shows how to take user input in a program.
Then, read the APCS Unit 1 Lab Excercises PDF and try to write the two programs on your own. 
MathFunctions.java and LunchTime.java are my sample solutions.
