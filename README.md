Practice Labs and Solutions for AP Computer Science A

Here I will explain the format of this repository, which is extra Labs to do in AP Computer Science A from my high school's class. For each unit, take a look at the pdf, try writing the programs, and see my solutions.

Unit 1: Primitive Types

First, you can take a look at HelloWorld.java, which is typically the first program students write.
ScannerExample.java shows how to take user input in a program.
Then, read the APCS Unit 1 Lab Excercises PDF and try to write the two programs on your own. 
MathFunctions.java and LunchTime.java are my sample solutions.

Unit 2: Objects

All of the Labs for this unit are in APCS Unit 2 Lab Excercises.pdf. Three of the labs have Tester Labs that must be run in the same project in order for the code to work. Additionally, I wrote AdventureLab.java, which is a program for the game hangman that might be helpful to take a look at.

Unit 3: Conditionals

This is a 3-part lab in APCS Unit 3 Lab Excercises.pdf. The parts are labeled LabPart1.java, LabPart2.java, and LabPart3.java.

Unit 4: Iterations
