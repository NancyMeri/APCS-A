Practice Labs and Solutions for AP Computer Science A

Here I will explain the format of this repository, which is extra Labs to do in AP Computer Science A from my high school's class.

Unit 1: Primitive Types

First, you can take a look at HelloWorld.java, which is typically the first program students write.
ScannerExample.java shows how to take user input in a program.
Then, read the APCS Unit 1 Lab Excercises PDF and try to write the two programs on your own. 
MathFunctions.java and LunchTime.java are my sample solutions.

Unit 2: Objects

All of the Labs for this unit are in Unit_2_Labs.pdf. Try writing those programs, and see my solutions which are named accordingly (three of the labs have Tester Labs that must be run in the same project in order for the code to work). Additionally, I wrote AdventureLab.java, which is a program for the game hangman that might be helpful to take a look at.
