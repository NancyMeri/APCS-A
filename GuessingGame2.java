/* Modify your program from Guessing Game 1. All the conditions from the 
 * previous program still hold, but now, the user has a limit on the 
 * number of guesses he or she is allowed. If the user is not able to guess 
 * the number within 6 tries, the game is over and appropriate output should 
 * be printed.
 */

/* Guessing Game 1 instructions:
 * Create a program that will use a while loop to play a guessing game. 
 * Your game should have (1) a variable that holds the winning number 
 * between the values of 1 and 100 inclusive (you should use Math.random() 
 * to generate this number), and (2) a variable that will hold the userâ€™s 
 * guess. Incorporate if statements to guide the user towards the right 
 * answer (e.g. let the know if their guess is too high or too low).
